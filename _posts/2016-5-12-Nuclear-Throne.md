title: My love for game design, and Nuclear Throne
---

So, as you may or may not (probably not) know, I've made a handful of [half-finished games](https://nocomplygames.com/) in Unity. For Example...

*Well actually, one of them was made in Android Studio, but I do plan on porting it to Unity someday...*

Anyways, as I was saying, I enjoy making games. So much so, that even when I am not making games, I am often watching videos and tips on game marketing, design, and industry news. Mostly, these videos/tips are all pertaining to indie game developers, since I actually enjoy indie games more than the "Big Name" or "Triple A" games that come out nowadays. They tend to just be so much more fun, and really dig into the roots of gaming for me, and take it to places I couldn't even imagine as a kid. And to be honest, I really want to take my free time of the next semester of my school to focus on doing an indie game myself. I have tried doing it in teams before, Which is great to do and I am very happy with the games I've made in a team. But I really want to lead the game as my own, as in, I want to cover the design of the game, the marketing, the images, the communitty, and the features of it. Though, I do not plan on doing it ALL myself, I defintely will need/seek help with things like art, and possibly some level design. But more as a "Hey, could you freelance this  character for me?", rather than "Sure, I can put this art in for a feature you wanted to add to the game, that I think will out-scope the project."

I hope I don't sound like a cock-y know-it-all, because I will be the first to admit, I've only made 4 unfinished games, which my roomate and I agreed that together they collectively make 1 full game and a third of a game. And, I watch a lot of subjective videos on game design/theory, and I'm preety sure I'm on the [tip of mount stupid.](https://youtu.be/PZn9a9-Gyc0?t=15m15s)

*I honestly need to compile a nice little list of resources I've found on game design, if anyone cares to read this, I can definitely get it done if you would like. Just let me know, I have social links across the page! But in the meantime, I wrote up a tiny one a while back in the [Super Punch Legacy wiki](https://github.com/torch2424/Punch-Legacy/wiki/Game-Design-Marketing-Business-Model-Videos-&-Resources)*

But, Let me get on to the second part of the title of this article. Which would be "Nuclear Throne".

What is Nuclear Throne you may ask? Well, it's probably one of the best games I have played in a long long time. Like, I'm talking, after the first hours of playing, I knew it was top five. I mean, just look at it...

I'm honestly hooked. I've already sunken 24 hours into the game (Which is actually kinda rare for me nowadays) and I plan to sink 24 more.

The game is designed really well by the guys at [Vlambeer](http://www.vlambeer.com/). And I can go on for days about how well designed the game is. From the huge bullets, screenshake feedback, ridicolous guns, easy replayabiliy, and more. I could honestly do an entire post on just why nuclear throne is such a well crafted game.

I actually have A LOT of respect for the guys at Vlambeer, because when I reffered to those game design talks, the ones by Vlambeer inspire me the most. And the one that really got my mind thinking about how to make an awesome game, was This talk by JW from Vlambeer. It's just pure genius and gold.

I honestly learn soemthing new every time I watch it. From a new idea on how to make a game look desireable and feel amazing. To where he simply states "Just fill your games with tiny details and love".

Well anyways, I think I've rambled enough. I am sure none of it makes sense, and that there are plenty of typos. As I am typing this at 3AM, and I have a Final for operating systems tommorow. Hopefully I can make some more gamedev blog posts soon. But I feel like my next will probably be about [a certain company I am interning for in the next couple of weeks, and the experiences I will have over there](http://www.amazon.com/). Or maybe how i spent a week playing with  [Vagrant?](https://www.vagrantup.com/) I don't know, but I should really go to bed. Till next time!

Peace!
