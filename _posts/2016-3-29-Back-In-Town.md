title: Back In Town
---

As you may or may not know, I am a long beach native, and I love it there. But I originally hail from a little big town named Moreno Valley.

Kinda looks like that...

But yeah, it's always nice visiting out here, not only do I get to hang out with my
[rad skate buddies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OktGiy8GWg)
but, I also usually get some cool code stuff done. Like, last time, I learned how to spin up droplets using Digital Ocean, and now I have two droplets set up doing all kinds of cool stuff like hosting sites with apache, or nginx. Also, sometimes minecraft servers, cause I mean...why not?

But yeah, glad to be home!

P.S the air is really dry out here, someone please save my sinuses.
