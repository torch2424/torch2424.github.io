# Welcome to my blog!

I want to give a shout out to my mom, all my buddies in my home town, all the code and coffee guys, my girlfriends...wait what?

Just kidding.

Welcome to my blog! I plan on very occasionally posting cool little code things I find, stories about my life, cool links to music that I find, and various guides as reference for myself (and hopefully others) in development.

And if you haven't noticed, I want to keep things chillin'. Like chillin' like a villain...chillin'.

I hope you guys enjoy this new adventure that I am embarking on, and hopefully I'll write some stuff someone other than me will read. (Even if it's just me, that'd be rad too haha)!

So...

Yeah!

I mean like...

Yeah! :D
