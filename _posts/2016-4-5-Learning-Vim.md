title: Learning Vim 
---

Hello!

By suggestion of one of the David's (Gaskins to be exact) I started learning vim! I found this cool website known as
["Vim Adventures"](http://vim-adventures.com/). Which really helps with getting started in my opinion. I even created this post,
in vim by following that. There's also a really nice easy program that is avalable for most linux distros you can install by
typing (in ubuntu): `sudo apt-get install vim`, and then `vimtutor`. This will bring up this nice, easy to play with vim guide
for you to use!

So yeah...Peace!
