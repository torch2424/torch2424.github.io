I probably haven't mentioned it on the blog yet, but I actually received a summer internship at Amazon!
I am as equally as excited, as I am nervous! And I start tommorow!

Checking into my flight, and my hotel, all felt so unreal...Like, as if someone was going to just tell me
it was one elaborate prank. But it's all real, and I'm thankful for it!

I am quite sad to have to leave my buddies in long beach, and my girlfriend for the summer. But this is
all a huge step in my career, and I am quite excited.

However, as a part of working for a big tech company, I am on salary, therefore, I cannot work on my
personal projects, or anything open-source. So those will ahve to be put on hold.

But anyways, I'm in Seattle, and hopefull I can blog about my adventures!

P.S here are some awesome links to an intern's guide to seattle:
