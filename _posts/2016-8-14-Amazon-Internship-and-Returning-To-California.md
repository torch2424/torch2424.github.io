# I Really Enjoyed My Internship At Amazon...

I am sure a lot of my close buddies, family, and potential interns will be asking me, how was it to intern at Amazon. Honestly, it was amazing, and I would suggest it to any young developer out there. It's really eye-opening, and really puts your own skill into perspective, along with all kinds of really amazing things.

### Interviewing for Amazon

I guess I can start by giving a brief overview of what I did. Without going too into detail about anything, since HR at Amazon couldn't answer my questions before I left. So, I applied for the 12-week summer Amazon internship around September, and got an email saying they were interested in offering me an internship. For an intern, you start by doing an online debug test (which is very similar to CodeFights, and quite easy in my opinion), and then you do a phone interview. In my phone interview, I got a really kind and well-spoken individual, who asked me to solve a Breath-Depth search problem. I didn't know it was Breath-Depth till after, but essentially it involved adding rows in a binary tree. Funny enough, my landline phone did not have a speaker option, so I did it all with one hand, and I finished in exactly 45 minutes (you are given about an hour in the phone interview, but the other 15 is for general introductions). I coded the problem very inefficiently, but I stressed to the interviewer I would definitely be going back to improve it, if I had Google, and a little more time. As he was reviewing my code, he thought I made a mistake, but I told him I did not, and we could come to a solution together if it was indeed wrong. But, I was right, and we then gave our goodbyes. The whole time during the internship, I tried my best to appear to the interviewer as "The friendly intern who knows a little bit about code, but is willing to learn, and is easy to work with". I even used the word we alot as I thought about my code (out loud). Thankfully, I found out about 3 weeks later I got the internship!

**My general tips for a big company code interview are: Be very friendly and be someone that is really easy to work with (because even if you cant code, you'd still be nice to have around), Do code fights or any online debug tests, code on a personal project in the language you will be interviewing in, check that your land line HAS A SPEAKER PHONE OPTION, and read "Cracking The Coding Interview"**

### Preparing for Amazon

My amazon recruiter told me that there was nothing I could do in the meantime to prepare for my internship, and they encourage me not try to prepare for it. But at the time, my perspective of Amazon, is that everyone was light years ahead of me in code, so i wanted to be as familiar as I could with whatever I was learning. So, I eventually learned I would be on the "Speech Platform" team. After hearing this, I did some research and asked some buddies, and I decided I should look into Machine Learning and Natural Language processing. So, I learned a bit of python using Google's AWESOME machine learning Youtube series, and I made a machine learning program that could analyze text and learn if it was a meme or not! However, after this, I found out I would be working on Alexa, which is REALLY exciting!

My manager then voluntarily reached out to me to answer any questions I had, which is awesome, and I am quite thankful for it. I found out that I would actually be working in AngularJS (Which is what I was already very comfortable with, and love working in), and I would be working on developer facing tools for Alexa. I was a little bummed that I didnt get to use any of my new Machine Learning knowledge, but I was quite excited to be working in Angular, and being developer facing. My manager was someone I knew I would get along with from the beginning, and was a super cool guy (He used to skate like me!).

Also, for living situations, Graebel/Aboda (Amazon's intern housing provider), offered me the following options: Single 1bd room corporate housing, Shared 2bd corporate housing, Hotel for the entire summer, shared UW dorm room apartment, and shared 1bd apartment for yourself and any guest that would need to be living with you (Spouse, or family). I knew my girlfriend would be visiting me a couple of times, so I requested the following:

1. Single 1bd apartment
2. Hotel for the summer
3. Shared UW dorm

However, I ended up getting the hotel for the first month, and then they moved me to the UW dorms for the last two months. Which wasn't optimal (I'll explain more in my "Living in Seattle"). However, Amazon was kind enough to pay for a flight for my girlfriend to visit, which was extremely nice, and I was VERY grateful for it :)
