# I Really Enjoyed My Internship At Amazon...

I am sure a lot of my close buddies, family, and potential interns will be asking me, how was it to intern at Amazon. Honestly, it was amazing, and I would suggest it to any young developer out there. It's really eye-opening, and really puts your own skill into perspective, along with all kinds of really amazing things.

### Interviewing for Amazon

I guess I can start by giving a brief overview of what I did. Without going too into detail about anything, since HR at Amazon couldn't answer my questions before I left. So, I applied for the 12-week summer Amazon internship around September, and got an email saying they were interested in offering me an internship. For an intern, you start by doing an online debug test (which is very similar to CodeFights, and quite easy in my opinion), and then you do a phone interview. In my phone interview, I got a really kind and well-spoken individual, who asked me to solve a Breath-Depth search problem. I didn't know it was Breath-Depth till after, but essentially it involved adding rows in a binary tree. Funny enough, my landline phone did not have a speaker option, so I did it all with one hand, and I finished in exactly 45 minutes (you are given about an hour in the phone interview, but the other 15 is for general introductions). I coded the problem very inefficiently, but I stressed to the interviewer I would definitely be going back to improve it, if I had Google, and a little more time. As he was reviewing my code, he thought I made a mistake, but I told him I did not, and we could come to a solution together if it was indeed wrong. But, I was right, and we then gave our goodbyes. The whole time during the internship, I tried my best to appear to the interviewer as "The friendly intern who knows a little bit about code, but is willing to learn, and is easy to work with". I even used the word we alot as I thought about my code (out loud). Thankfully, I found out about 3 weeks later I got the internship!

**My general tips for a big company code interview are: Be very friendly and be someone that is really easy to work with (because even if you cant code, you'd still be nice to have around), Do code fights or any online debug tests, code on a personal project in the language you will be interviewing in, check that your land line HAS A SPEAKER PHONE OPTION, and read "Cracking The Coding Interview"**

### Preparing for Amazon

My amazon recruiter told me that there was nothing I could do in the meantime to prepare for my internship, and they encourage me not try to prepare for it. But at the time, my perspective of Amazon, is that everyone was light years ahead of me in code, so i wanted to be as familiar as I could with whatever I was learning. So, I eventually learned I would be on the "Speech Platform" team. After hearing this, I did some research and asked some buddies, and I decided I should look into Machine Learning and Natural Language processing. So, I learned a bit of python using Google's AWESOME machine learning Youtube series, and I made a machine learning program that could analyze text and learn if it was a meme or not! However, after this, I found out I would be working on Alexa, which is REALLY exciting!

My manager then voluntarily reached out to me to answer any questions I had, which is awesome, and I am quite thankful for it. I found out that I would actually be working in AngularJS (Which is what I was already very comfortable with, and love working in), and I would be working on developer facing tools for Alexa. I was a little bummed that I didnt get to use any of my new Machine Learning knowledge, but I was quite excited to be working in Angular, and being developer facing. My manager was someone I knew I would get along with from the beginning, and was a super cool guy (He used to skate like me!).

Also, for living situations, Graebel/Aboda (Amazon's intern housing provider), offered me the following options: Single 1bd room corporate housing, Shared 2bd corporate housing, Hotel for the entire summer, shared UW dorm room apartment, and shared 1bd apartment for yourself and any guest that would need to be living with you (Spouse, or family). I knew my girlfriend would be visiting me a couple of times, so I requested the following:

1. Single 1bd apartment
2. Hotel for the summer
3. Shared UW dorm

However, I ended up getting the hotel for the first month, and then they moved me to the UW dorms for the last two months. Which wasn't optimal (I'll explain more in my "Living in Seattle"). However, Amazon was kind enough to pay for a flight for my girlfriend to visit, which was extremely nice, and I was VERY grateful for it :)

### Working at Amazon

I learned a lot from working at Amazon. Not only did I learn about different coding practices and how to code better, but also, I learned a lot about corporate culture, and the developers that work for these big companies. These are the main things I learned at Amazon:

**Things I learned at Amazon**

* Rebasing in Git. Amazon uses their own git management system, and has a very odd git flow in my opinion. But because of this, I couldn't get away with a lot of my debug, and testing commits, as each commit represented a feature, rather than parts of a story. My mentor was kind enough to show me this, and I definitely am going to try to start doing this in my personal projects.

* AngularJS Directives. In my angular projects, I have used directives many times, but never at the scale that the project I worked on used them. Almost every component on the pages were a directive. And because of this, when I created my own, I had to dive deep into how they were creating theirs

* Alexa Skill Development. I learned how to make skills for Alexa, which is quite fun. I currently have one published, and I definitely plan on making more for my Echo.

* How to behave at a corporate company. Software development is very laid back. As in, it is extremely casual, and everyone wears what they would like, and isn't afraid to express themselves. Personally, I see myself as an EXTREMELY casual person, and I often say very out-of-the-box things. However, I always think before I do or say anything, so I definitely had to slowly see where the points were. I am glad to say, I definitely felt like myself while at Amazon. But, there are definitely some unspoken rules about what you can/can't say. And what you can/can't joke about.

* Web Scale. Pushing to production is a big deal anywhere you work. But, it matters more than ever when thousands or millions of users are using your code. I defintely got to see how Amazon does things like Continous deployment, and the lifecycle of how code is run and tested before reaching production. I definitely learned how to code for edge cases much better, and how Quality Assurance is done at such a large scale.

* Estimating code. Estimating how long code will take

* How to handle an always changing team. While at Amazon, my team grew 5 more developers (including myself), but we also lost 3 developers (including myself). I learned that teams are almost ALWAYS changing. From skating in the past with my skate crew, I definitely have a strong sense of team work, brotherhood, and group mentality. And, I definitely brought that with me, and I do feel like I helped the team come closer together. But, It is quite hard to say good bye, and I can definitely see why software teams are close, but not ride-or-die for one another. Because they join and leave so often.

I definitely feel like I grew exponentially as an developer, and my manager was kind enough to let me keep the feedback he gave me, and I wrote down all of the career advice the junior and senior developers gave me. And next, I would like to go into a pros and cons of Amazon:

**Pros of working at Amazon:**

* Web Scale. Like I said above, if you want a big impact on the world, this is the place to do it.

* Friendly employees. 90% of all the employees I met at Amazon were very awesome to be around. I did not dislike anyone there, and I definitely became close with a lot of people there.

* Build Process and Workflow. I is very enlightening to see how Amazon works, since they are such a large scale. You definitely get to see a lot ideologies you can bring with you wherever you code.

* Wikis and Tech talks. Amazon has a wealth of information that is all kept internally I watched about 10 tech talks that greatly expanded my knowledge on array of things such as: Code, AngularJS, Golang, Work life balance, Tech debt, Scrum, etc...

* Competent developers and employees. Everyone I met at Amazon was very smart. After working at start ups, or clients who think they know code. It is very nice to work with UX designers, project managers, and other developers that understand what they are saying, and are willing to work with you to create a feature.

* Freedom. Amazon provides a lot of freedom. My manager allowed me to come in at any reasonable time (just be here in time for daily meetings around 11am). And I was allowed to leave whenever I felt like I was at a good stopping point for the day. So, if I was working on a small or easy feature, and I got it done fast, I could leave after only 6 hours of work. However, I will admit, when I was crunching to get a feature done, I did work a few 10-11 hour days. But, it definitely averaged out to about less than 8 hours a day.

* Networking opprotunnities. You meet so many talented people at Amazon, with a wide array of connections. I was fortunate enoguh to hand my business card to everyone at Amazon I worked with, and I definitely feel like I slammed doors open for myself in the future.

* You work with the best of the best. Really, you get to work with those that have created AMAZING projects at a huge scale. They is alot of opprotunitty to grow, and work with great developers, and it is awesome.

* Free food, and tons of events. As an intern there were a ton of really fun intern events (mostly during the beginning and end of the internship). But, there were also a lot of org/team specific events that happened, and if you look for them, theres almost an event every day for you to meet other Amazonians, with free food and drinks! (mostly alcholic ones too ;)). Also, Amazon recently started a free communitty banna stand, which was really nice because it meant I got to eat two free bannanas for breakfast every morning :)

* Seattle. (I'll explain more in living in Seattle)

**Cons of working at Amazon:**

* Workflow and tools. Ironic right? As a huge open-source developer, I come across a BUNCH of amazing open-source tools. And I will admit, most of the tools I used were up to about 20x as fast as Amazon tools. Amazon works mostly in Eclipse/java, so their tools are really geared towards Eclipse/java development. Even when working with Eclipse/Java development, you still run into a few road blocks, or trouble getting everything set up when you create a new project. Any other development outside of this is generally slapped on to their internal tools, and really slow things down. My workflow is usualy Vagrant, Npm, Grunt, Sass, Sentry, etc... And they do have some alternatives to these, but honestly, just aren't as good. They are very out dated as well, and had a VERY steep learning curve. And the tools they did not have alternatives for, they kind of just worked around, and when i asked to use them, or introduce them to the team. I kind of got blank stares, or they would take forever to get past IT and legal teams.

* Random Legal Requirements. Like I just mentioned above. I wasnt allowed to use a lot of tools due to they may be leaking Amazon information. This is completely understandable, but there is not quick way to get things approved. Also, I had to sign many legalese-y documents on what I can/can't do while working at Amazon, and when I reached out to get more information on it, it took extremely long, and I never really got a clear answer on it.

* Lack of passion for code. I definitely felt like most of the developers at Amazon see code as a way to make money. A lot of the developers did not pursue any kind of code, or keep up with the development communitty. This is undesrstandable because of non-competition agreements, but there are definitely ways to get a personal project approved, and mine only took a few days. It was quite sad to see, as I am very passionate about code, and I enjoy it very much. And, when I would ask someone if they keep up with code or communities outside of work, the strange looks of, "Why would I work outside of work", was quite off-putting. Or, the "Code takes me the least effort to make the most money" was kinda of lame to see too. And to be honest, you could see this in a lot of the code quality at Amazon.

* Corporate Politics. There is a lot of arguing, and seniority that kinda ominously floats around Amazon. Though, I am sure this is at every company, I did not like how this was. I don't enjoy arguing at all honestly, and when people would shut me down because I was the intern, but then find out later I was right, it wasn't really even that satisfying.

* Seattle (I'll explain more in living in Seattle).

* Also, there are a few more minor things that i can't think of right now, but I will add them as I remember.

**So What Exactly did I do at Amazon?**

While at Amazon, I worked on the Alexa Developer Experience Team. While there, I made two Alexa skills, created some new components for the production project my team worked, and created an unnounced feature for Alexa on the production project as well. I was orinally only supposed to make a single skill, and a single component for the production team project, but I got things done quickly, and it was a lot of fun. I am really grateful for the team, manager, and mentor I had, and I really hope I can see all of them again sometime in the future. They were all extremely mellow and cool people to be around. And I had a lot of fun developing with them.
